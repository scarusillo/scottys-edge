# Scotty's Edge — Master Agent To-Do List
**Last updated:** 2026-04-20 — post v25.35 / v25.36 / v25.37 ship session

---

## 🔴 OPEN CRITICAL — TOP PRIORITY

### 1. Secondary spread model (data-driven) — coexist with Elo model + fade flip

**Concept:** Keep the existing Elo-based spread model AS-IS. It's our "divergence
detector" — its wrongness feeds `SPREAD_FADE_FLIP` (+140u backtest). Build a
SECOND spread model alongside it that uses real inputs to find genuine spread
edges the Elo model misses.

**Why not replace Elo:**
- Fade flip is actively printing money because Elo is broken in playoffs
- Replacing Elo would kill that edge for an unproven new model
- Both can coexist — different games get picked by different engines

**Proposed architecture:**
```
For each game:
    elo_spread      = existing Elo-based projection
    data_spread     = NEW model (injuries, lineup, rest, motivation, H2H, form)
    market_spread   = best market line

    Path 1 — FADE_FLIP (keep):
        IF |elo_spread - market_spread| > max_div:
            SPREAD_FADE_FLIP fires  (opposite side of Elo)

    Path 2 — DATA-DRIVEN PICKS (new):
        data_edge = (data_model vs market) at best book
        IF data_edge >= 20% AND |data_spread - market_spread| < max_div:
            Fire own-pick at market line  (real edge)

    Path 3 — BOTH models agree AND market disagrees (rare, high conviction):
        Stake boost (+1u) or fire at lower edge threshold
```

**Data inputs to build (ranked by impact):**
| Input | Source | Complexity | Impact |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| Injury list (starters out) | ESPN injuries API | Medium | 🔥 Biggest single win |
| Confirmed starting lineup | ESPN boxscore pre-game | Medium | Captures rest decisions |
| Rest days / back-to-back | Schedule data (have) | Easy | 1-2 pts per B2B |
| Motivation (seeding/tanking/elim) | Standings + rules | Hard | Big playoff impact |
| Recent form vs season avg | Existing game_results | Easy | Hot/cold streaks |
| H2H history | Existing game_results | Easy | Matchup-specific |

**Integration points:**
- `context_engine.py` already has `spread_adj` infrastructure — add new adjustment types
- Each input contributes spread_adj delta applied to `ms` (e.g., star out → -5 pts)
- Keep elo_spread computation untouched (for fade flip continuity)
- Add `data_spread` as a parallel output used for Path 2 picks

**Scope:** 2-4 weeks of evening work. Most time is API plumbing + player name normalization. Model changes are small.

**When to start:**
- Wait 3-4 weeks to let SPREAD_FADE_FLIP mature (2026-04-20 → 2026-05-11 minimum)
- If fade flip win rate drops below 55% before then → start earlier
- If fade flip holds 60%+ → start 2026-05-11 as planned

**Success metric:** Data-driven picks produce +20u+ over a 2-week backtest on historical spreads where fade flip didn't fire (i.e., games inside `max_div` threshold).

## 🟡 OTHER OPEN

None of the other original items are critical — rest are monitors / research.

## ✅ COMPLETED (2026-04-11)

- [x] **Retasked all 15 hourly `ScottysEdge_XXAM/PM` scheduled tasks to use `auto_run_afternoon.bat` wrapper** — verified via `schtasks /Query`. All 15 tasks (06AM through 08PM) now point at the bat wrapper instead of calling `python.exe` directly. Every future run will capture both stdout and stderr to `auto_run.log`, and combined with v25.9's uncaught exception handler, the pipeline is now completely observable — no more silent failures.

## ✅ RESOLVED THIS SESSION (2026-04-11)

### Infrastructure + Observability
- [x] **db-latest upload pipeline** — fixed `upload_db.py` with `--draft=false` so cloud agents can fetch the DB
- [x] **`Retention pruning: timedelta not defined` silent bug** — fixed cmd_grade timedelta import (v25.7)
- [x] **ESPN backfill DB connection leak** — wrapped `backfill_missing` + `backfill_thin_teams` in try/finally (v25.7)
- [x] **Pipeline observability** — uncaught exception handler added to `main.py` (v25.9). Any future crash writes full traceback to `pipeline.log`.
- [x] **🔥 `_social_media_card` NameError** — **ROOT CAUSE of today's silent pipeline failures.** One undefined variable `tu` in an unwrapped code block killed every "has picks" scheduled run. Fixed in v25.10.

### Briefing + Stats Card Fixes
- [x] **Shadowed factor filter** — briefing stops showing phantom alerts (v25.7)
- [x] **Tennis lumping** — single "TENNIS" row in both stats card and morning briefing (v25.7 + v25.8)

### Twitter Cleanup Residue
- [x] `#GamblingTwitter` hashtag removed (v25.7)
- [x] 152-line `generate_thread()` dead function removed (v25.7)
- [x] X handle dropped from `SOCIALS` constant (v25.8)

### Dead Code / Unused Imports
- [x] `home_away_split_adjustment` removed from `context_engine.py` (v25.7)
- [x] `calculate_true_vig` removed from `scottys_edge.py` (v25.7)
- [x] 9 unused imports purged across 7 files (v25.7)

### Pre-Run Validator Agent Prompt Fixes
- [x] Removed phantom gate checks: `CONCENTRATION_CAP`, `MIN_EDGE`, `BLOWOUT_GATE` (zero-block false alarm), tennis `clay`
- [x] Agent now queries real gate names: `DIRECTION_CAP`, `SPORT_CAP`, `GAME_CAP`, `CROSS_RUN_CAP`, etc.
- [x] Saved `reference_gate_reason_strings.md` to memory so this discovery persists

### Apr 6–10 Drawdown Post-Mortem
- [x] Investigated, traced all -26.4u of losses to v24-v25.3 fixes already shipped. Net new action items: zero.

### Same-Day Rescues
- [x] Today's 10 picks manually posted to IG story (both card slides)
- [x] Glossary carousel posted to IG feed (pinnable — 2 slides)
- [x] Picks email sent manually (subject: "🎯 RESCUE — Morning Picks — 2026-04-11")
- [x] Daily Reel posted to IG with 6-2 +13.4u recap

## 🟡 Today-Specific (check if still relevant)

- [x] **TOR/ATL power ratings sanity check** — stale, resolved 2026-04-18. Picks fired on these teams post-4/11 went 2-1 (+3.4u); model calibration is fine.
- [x] **`pitcher_scraper` Imai classification** — stale, resolved 2026-04-18. Imai has only 7.5 IP total across 3 starts — well below the 30-IP ERA gate, so he can't affect model calculations. Original note confirmed "not a bug."

## 🟢 Monitor / Backlog

- [ ] **Daily check:** Home letdown spot 2nd-half P/L (currently -9.1u, threshold -15u, cushion 5.9u)
- [ ] H2H high-scoring factor — 1W-2L, -5.3u (watch for accumulation)
- [ ] Chase Field park double-counting — 1W-3L, -10.4u (already reduced from +0.9 → +0.6 in v23.1)
- [ ] Add tennis surface-specialist Elo override (deferred until tennis returns — clay tightening in v24 may already be sufficient)
- [x] **v24 two-week review** — completed Apr 18 (2 days early). Verdict: successful. CLV +0.21 → +0.41; record -18u is variance on 88 bets (CI [39.6%, 60.4%] includes pre-v24 56.8%). See `project_v24_review_apr18.md`. Next review: May 2.

### Cleanups completed 2026-04-18

- [x] **`config.py` SPORT_CONFIG drift** — removed dead-code copy. Runtime uses `model_engine.py` only; verified all live imports.
- [x] **Drop `prop_snapshots_pre_v25_2`** — already dropped in a prior session, confirmed via DB scan.
- [x] **Verify `model_total` writing to `market_consensus`** — column exists but 0/10,499 rows populated. Not a bug (nothing reads it), but documented: no live writer, low-priority cleanup if we ever reclaim the column.

### Added 2026-04-18 (moved from in-session task list — passive, sample-gated)

- [ ] **NBA props sample** — currently 3W-7L, -17.1u, avg CLV +1.32. Flag if WR stays &lt;40% through 20 picks. Trigger: n ≥ 20.
- [ ] **NCAA Baseball NO_MOVEMENT signal** — 1W-5L, -20.6u when sharps don't move the line. Possible fade candidate. Trigger: re-check at n ≥ 15 (currently n=6).
- [ ] **NBA SHARP_CONFIRMS stake-boost decision** — zero picks fired with this signal yet. Per `project_steam_monitor.md`, decision point at 15-20 picks.
- [ ] **NBA model calibration review** — 28W-27L, -7.7u season-to-date despite positive CLV. Audit recommends full calibration review at the May checkpoint.
- [ ] **ATP tennis surface/round model** — Monte Carlo closed 1-3, -10.7u (n=4, small sample but early indicator). Review surface-specific calibration and round-filter before the next clay event.

## 📝 Do NOT Act On (stale phantom alerts)

Morning briefing items referencing already-shadowed factors:
- Home fast-paced (shadowed v21)
- Away bounce-back (shadowed v21)
- Altitude (shadowed v21)
- Home hot streak (shadowed v21)
- Away revenge (shadowed v21)
- Away letdown (shadowed v24)
- Friday game (resolved — was driven by NCAA UNDERs that are now blocked)

These are ghost alerts from historical data. The briefing-script suppression fix (v25.7) prevents new phantom alerts going forward, but older briefings may still reference these.
